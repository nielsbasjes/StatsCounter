/**
 * This Comparable Rating implementation is based upon:
 * http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/15979/how-to-find-confidence-intervals-for-ratings
 * 
 * Bayesian Approach I: Normal Distribution over Ratings 
 * 
 * One way of moving the estimated rating toward a prior is, as in Karl's answer, 
 * to use an estimate of the form 
 * 
 *    w*R+(1âˆ’w)*C
 * 
 * R is the mean over the ratings for the items. 
 * C is the mean over all items (or whatever prior you want to shrink your rating to). 
 * Note that the formula is just a weighted combination of R and C. 
 * 
 * w=v/(v+m) is the weight assigned to R, where v is the number of reviews for the beer 
 * and m is some kind of constant "threshold" parameter. 
 * Note that when v is very large, i.e., when we have a lot of ratings for the current item, 
 * then w is very close to 1, so our estimated rating is very close to R and we pay little 
 * attention to the prior C. When v is small, however, w is very close to 0, so the estimated 
 * rating places a lot of weight on the prior C. This estimate can, in fact, be given a 
 * Bayesian interpretation as the posterior estimate of the item's mean rating
 * when individual ratings comes from a normal distribution centered around that mean.
 * 
 * However, assuming that ratings come from a normal distribution has two
 * problems: 
 * - A normal distribution is continuous, but ratings are discrete.
 * - Ratings for an item don't necessarily follow a unimodal Gaussian shape. For
 *   example, maybe your item is very polarizing, so people tend to either give it
 *   a very high rating or give it a very low rating.
